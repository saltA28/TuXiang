/**
 * A generic renderer interface.
 * <p>
 * The renderer is responsible for making OpenGL calls to render a frame.
 * <p>
 *
 * <div class="special reference">
 * <h3>Developer Guides</h3>
 * <p>For more information about how to use OpenGL, read the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/graphics/opengl.html">OpenGL</a> developer guide.</p>
 * </div>
 *
 * <h3>Threading</h3>
 * The renderer will be called on a separate thread, so that rendering
 * performance is decoupled from the UI thread. Clients typically need to
 * communicate with the renderer from the UI thread, because that's where
 * input events are received. Clients can communicate using any of the
 * standard Java techniques for cross-thread communication.
 * <p>
 * <h3>EGL Context Lost</h3>
 * There are situations where the EGL rendering context will be lost. This
 * typically happens when device wakes up after going to sleep. When
 * the EGL context is lost, all OpenGL resources (such as textures) that are
 * associated with that context will be automatically deleted. In order to
 * keep rendering correctly, a renderer must recreate any lost resources
 * that it still needs. The {@link #onSurfaceCreated(GL10, EGLConfig)} method
 * is a convenient place to do this.

     * be lost when the Android device awakes after going to sleep.
     * <p>
     * Since this method is called at the beginning of rendering, as well as
     * every time the EGL context is lost, this method is a convenient place to put
     * code to create resources that need to be created when the rendering
     * starts, and that need to be recreated when the EGL context is lost.
     * Textures are an example of a resource that you might want to create
     * here.
     * <p>
     * Note that when the EGL context is lost, all OpenGL resources associated
     * with that context will be automatically deleted. You do not need to call
     * the corresponding "glDelete" methods such as glDeleteTextures to
     * manually delete these lost resources.
